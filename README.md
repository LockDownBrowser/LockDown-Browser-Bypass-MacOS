# Respondus LockDown Browser Bypass For MacOS/Windows

**NOTE: this bypass is free and requires a VM (virtual machine) and was created solely because running respondus LockDown Browser on your personal computer appears to be a horrible decision due to multiple reports of malfunctions/breaks that this safe exam application provides.**

respondus uses private apis (undocumented functions that aren't supported/known for ruining devices if not used properly) and has questionable functions like grabNotifications , sleepExploit() and many more, the use of private apis have ruined alot of computers driving them to factory reset it forcefully and i am one of the victims of this horrific unfortunate mischievous act.

respondus shouldnt exist, they even are funded by government institutes in the middle east so god knows what they are up to with having access to all of our system/personal files at low level

if you want to run respondus LockDown Browser on a Virtual Machine to ensure you laptop lives to tell the tale you may want to follow the insturctions

This bypass specifically on Windows uses a dll injector/dylib injector which is used for manipulating functions that lockdown browser uses in the memory which is different than binary patching but more efficient
